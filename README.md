Traffic Accident Analysis

Here, the task involves analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns linked to road conditions, weather, and time of day. 

The goal is to identify contributing factors to accidents and visualize accident hotspots. 

By exploring correlations between these variables, the analysis will help in understanding when and where accidents are more likely to occur. 

Visualization techniques, such as heatmaps and scatter plots, will be used to illustrate these findings and provide actionable insights for improving road safety.


Accident dataset upload process on the GitHub failed because of size(600+mb). So i give the link of the dataset which is in Kaggle.
